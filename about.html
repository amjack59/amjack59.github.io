<p>Hi, I am a happily married man and technology geek making my way along the path of coding bootcamp at Flatiron School to re-create a dream of coding and creating that I have had most of my adult life. While my interests are varied (fitness, movies, reading, learning, traveling, cars, self-improvement, sports, and especially spending time with my wife and son) my interest in technology, particularly in computers and programming has been a constant. So it is with enthusiasm and an eternal positive outlook that I travel this journey of life and learning for as far as it will take me.</p>
