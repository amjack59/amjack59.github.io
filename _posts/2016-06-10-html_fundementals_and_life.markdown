Like many things in life, learning the basics provides the foundation that we use to build bigger and better things. In the same way, learning HTML fundamentals allows us as web developers to learn the basics of how things are created on the web and provides the basis for the creation of web pages and sites with unlimited potential. Without learning the fundamentals of the HTML language there would forever be this void in our knowledge that would hold us back from our true potential. Much like learning how to talk as a child, learning how to speak the language of the web (to go along with all the other technologies such as CSS, Javascript, PHP, Python, Ruby and the like) enables us to communicate our thoughts and ideas. So it is that we take our first steps building a foundation on which we can rise even higher by establishing essential skills that can take us to places we never dreamed of. The journey and adventure of a lifetime begins with a single step and sees no end in sight and this is what makes learning so rewarding and so is the case for how HTML fundamentals and life share commonality.
